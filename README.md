I made a discord based bot that helps me with my FGO transfer codes, recently i've decided to bring them over from Google Docs to Discord. And to do that, i have created this bot to help convert the codes i type in Google Docs into a discord channel. It works so far i'm just looking for a place to host it for now, this will never see the light of day for anyone other than myself. If i am hacked then yeah sure feel free to take this. (jokes)
Anyway. Yeah. this is here.

Proof it works:

As you can see, as i stated before it's working SO FAR. 
i just need a permanent way to keep it running. easier said than done though..

This is the bot profile lol, 
i'll try to keep it soloist in a cage themed since that's one of my favorite mangas (I almost spelled mangos. Those who know: ☠️)
